Year 3044
Jace's POV

I walked down the stairs of my home going to school, like everyday. But today, something will be different. My breathing would be so much easier, without that piece of cloth covering my mouth. I got onto the pod which would carry me to school. The virus my parents made it seem so scary was gone. Eating my sandwich in the pod that carried me I thought of my friends.
