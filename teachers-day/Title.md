3044
Sypnopsis: It was the year 3044 and the virus has gone away, which was too perfect. It baffled everyone but no one complained. Scientists predict that the rest of the year will be fine, thinking it will be perfect. But all changed quickly, when a ship descended and covered the island

Year 3044, the year we all thought it was perfect, too perfect.
After over 1000 years of a virus staying with us, constantly mutating so the vaccine won't work, it faded.
Jace's POV

I walked down the stairs of my home going to school, like everyday. But today, something will be different. My breathing would be so much easier, without that piece of cloth covering my mouth. I got onto the pod which would carry me to school. The virus my parents made it seem so scary was gone. Eating my sandwich in the pod that carried me I thought of my friends. After years of not seeing my friends, this would be the first time I saw them. I can feel the akwardness that would soon overwhelm me when we met as it would be the first time meeting them in real life. The pod cruised to a halt as I reached the gates of our school and got off. I sucked in a deep breath and held my bag to my chest. This would be a new day.
